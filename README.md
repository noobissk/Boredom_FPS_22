# Boredom_FPS_22
'Builds' folder contains a fully functional version of the game. The original poorly made project.
'New_Build(EXPERIMENTAL)' contains the new !NOT YET FINISHED! version. It's more of a preview of the progress being made.

Game started as a quick 1-2 day project to flex on my friend out of boredom, hence the name. Later I started to add stuff like guns and wallrunning and I realised that this is becoming an entire project, so I decided that if i wanted to continue adding stuff, I'd have to re-do everything from the ground up. That's the reason for why 'New_Build(EXPERIMENTAL)' exists and why it's in the state that it is.
